# Lux AI

Description: My attempts/research into the Lux AI challenge and apply different machine learning techniques to maximize my score.


### Notes:

 - This game does support a local "offline" mode for Seasons 1 & 2. There are a few caveats in terms of the environment setup.
     - For Season 1, one must install nodeJS v12+ to globaly install the competition's design (`npm install -g @lux-ai/2021-challenge@latest`). For Python, the `kaggle-environments` package is required on top of the npm package (see the [Season 1 Kaggle Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/stonet2000/lux-ai-season-1-jupyter-notebook-tutorial/notebook)).
     - For Season 2, the game is 100% runnable from Python. Refer to the **Getting Started** section of the README.md for the Season 2 repository for the specifics.
